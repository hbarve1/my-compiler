# My Compiler (Brand name pending)

This project aims to build a general-purpose programming language like [**Dart**](https://dart.dev/) or **JavaScript**. This language can compile to any target given. Moreover, this language will have the flexibility to code in a language other than **English**, for example, **Sanskrit**, **Hindi**, **Tamil**, or any different language.

## Why? A big question

In the past, the development of all programming languages was done by experts to solve one particular problem, so will this programming language. The main problem is English for Non-English people. The primary and big idea is to let people do programming in their native language.

## Project Roadmap

- [ ] Collect as much data, resources on how to create your own programming language
- [ ] Collect samples of all the grammers of all other programming langugage
- [ ] Write grammer of our programming language
  - [ ] define keywords
  - [ ] Lexical Analyzer
  - [ ] Syntax Analyzer
  - [ ] Semantic Analyzer
  - [ ] Intermediate Code Generator
  - [ ] Code Optimizer
  - [ ] Target Code Generator
- [ ] Document all the steps and verify with the experts
- [ ] Make it popular with real world use-case.
